Welcome to the Updraft technical test. In this folder you will find a small
Django web service configured with Django REST framework. We recommend reading
this entire README all of the way through so that you understand the task,
expectations and what has been provided for you before making a start.

# Getting set up

Before getting started with the main tasks, you'll need to configure your
development environment and make sure the tests pass.

1. create a python 3 virtual environment
2. install dependencies with poetry
3. run the tests

## Create a Python 3 virtual environment

You will need a Python 3 venv to get started. For the purposes of this exercise,
any modern Python 3 version will be fine. If you have a prefered way of managing
venvs, then feel free to use that. If not, the following command will probably
be enough to get you going:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Install Dependencies with poetry

We use [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage python dependencies, if
you don't have it installed globally then you can install it in your venv using
pip like so:

```
pip install poetry
```

Now you can use it to install all of the dependencies:

```
poetry install
```

If you need to add a new library to the project, you can do so like this:

```
poetry add [--dev] <library>
```

This will update `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` with the new dependency so
that we will be able to install the same version when evaluating your solution.

## Sample (fixture) data

We've provided some fixture date that will create three users:

1. a super user "test-admin" for using django admin panel
2. a normal user "user1" with two bank accounts
3. a normal user "user2" with one bank account

Each user's password is the same as their username.

To load the sample data, ensure that your venv is active and then run all of the
database migrations and load the data using `manage.py`:

```
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py loaddata sample.json
```

Now if you run the server and browse to the admin panel
(http://localhost:8000/admin) log in as "test-admin" (password is also
"test-admin") you should see the three accounts and 419 sample transactions.

If you want to make use of this fixture data in any tests you write, be sure to
set the `fixtures` property of your `APITestCase` subclass:

```
class TestSomething(APITestCase):

    fixtures = ["sample.json"]

    def test_something(self):
        # there are three accounts in the fixture data
        assert Accounts.objects.count() == 3
```

## Run the tests

We use [`pytest`](https://pytest.org/) to run our tests:

```
pytest
```

You should see all tests failing, as the endpoints that they are testing have
not been implemented. As you work on your task, you may wish to add more tests
to ensure that you're covering all the important scenarios.

# Your task

You will need to create both list and retrieve endpoints for the `Account` and
`Transaction` models.

When building these endpoints, we encourage you to develop a solution that you
would consider to be clean, maintainable and uses Django REST framework's
built-in tools to fullfil the requirements. This exercise is less about "just
build something that works" and more "show us how you woud build this in a
larger production app." Django REST framework gives you a lot of tools out of
the box and we'd like you to use this as an opportunity to demonstrate your
knowledge of those tools to us.

The following URLs are expected to be supported:

- `GET /accounts/` - list all bank accounts
- `GET /accounts/:id` - retrieve the bank account with ID `:id`
- `GET /transactions/` - list all transactions
- `GET /transactions/:id` - retireve the transactions with ID `:id`

Additionally, these endpoints should meet the following requirements:

1. Users should only be able to see their own `Account`s and `Transaction`s,
   whilst an admin (as defined by the `User.is_staff` flag) should be able to
   view all accounts and transactions in the system.
2. All "list" endpoints should be paginated using cursor-based pagination.
3. The `Transaction`s list endpoint should be ordered with the most recent
   transactions first and allow a user to filter by:
   - a start and/or end timestamp
   - the ID of one of their accounts
   - a transaction category (see `accounts.models.TransactionCategory`)
4. The `Account` endpoints should include two fields that are not part of the
   normal `Account` model:
   - `transaction_count_last_thirty_days` which should be the count of all
     `Transaction`s that occured on this account in the last 30 days.
   - `balance_change_last_thirty_days` which should be the sum of all
     `Transaction`s that occurred on this account in the last 30 days.

An `Account` object should be represented like this when returned as part of an
API response:

```
{
    "id": 1,
    "user": 2,
    "name": "John Smith"
    "transaction_count_last_thirty_days": 119,
    "balance_change_last_thirty_days": "-1304.67",
}
```

(Note: the fields that calculate values for the last thirty days will change
values depending which day you actually do this test. Don't worry if yours come
out different. See `TestAccountsApiAsStaff::test_retrieve_account` in
`accounts/tests.py` for a way to fix this during testing with the `freeze_time`
annotation from the [freezegun](https://github.com/spulec/freezegun) package)

A `Transaction` object should be represented like this:

```
{
    "id": 1,
    "account": 1,
    "timestamp": "2022-06-12T17:36:58.632000Z",
    "amount": "-25.26",
    "description": "Tesco",
    "transaction_category": "PURCHASE"
}
```
